Ok bois and girls buckle your seatbelt cuz we bout to learn about

#GETTING STARTED WITH XCODE AND SWIFT

First of all shoutout to all of you guys who actually signed up for this thing. 
I probably should've started writing this course earlier...
But I guess it's like whatever now since I only have one semester with you guys so I can screw this club up **as much as I want** and not have to worry about it. #YOLO

So where were we?
Oh yea doing Xcode and stuff.

So... it's of the **absolute** importance that you guys have a mac or macbook or you guys will not be able to do anything in the future. 
You gonna have to download Xcode from the App Store which is not accesssible from non-Macs (duh).
~~Great start Jeremy~~~

Downloading Xcode takes some time so don't worry.
