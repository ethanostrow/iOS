Ok bois and girls buckle your seatbelt cuz we bout to learn about

#VARIABLES

First things first...
Variables are declared are declared with 'var'

For example...

```swift
var swagLevel = 9001
print(swagLevel)
//This would print 9001
```

You can change the value of variables by giving a holla at it again but with a **different** value

```swift
swagLevel = 0
print(swagLevel)
//This would print 0
```

#CONSTANTS

Constants are kinda like variables except they can't be changed. They're kinda like a loyal puppy... staying around with you until you die... or it dies... anyway...

You declare a constant like this...


```swift
let name = "Jeremy"
print(name)
//This would print Jeremy
```

#END OF THE LESSON CHALLENGE THING

1. Name of Godzilla.

2. Amount of letters in Godzilla.

3. If Godzilla is hungry or nah.

4. Amount of buildings Godzilla destroys.

5. Cost of repairing those buildings Godzilla just destroyed.

6. How pissed the government is at Godzilla.
