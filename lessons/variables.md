Ok bois and girls buckle your seatbelt cuz we bout to learn about

#VARIABLES

First things first...
Variables are declared are declared with 'var'

For example...

```swift
var swagLevel = 9001
print(swagLevel)
//This would print 9001
```

You can change the value of variables by giving a holla at it again but with a **different** value

```swift
swagLevel = 0
print(swagLevel)
//This would print 0
```

#CONSTANTS

Constants are kinda like variables except they can't be changed. They're kinda like a loyal puppy... staying around with you until you die... or it dies... anyway...

You declare a constant like this...


```swift
let name = "Jeremy"
print(name)
//This would print Jeremy
```
